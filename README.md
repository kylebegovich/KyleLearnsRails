## Kyle

This is the generic README. Basically all the write-ups are going to be directly taken from https://www.railstutorial.org/book/, so I'm not bothering to document (much) outside of the code.

I was told to do this to get used to branches... seems trivial but whatevs

Things you may want to cover:

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
